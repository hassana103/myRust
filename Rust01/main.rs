//chapter 1
//this is my first rust project
//i have created a directory and cd to it
//started the vs code 
//created a file called main.rs (this file)

// there should always be a main function - main function is the starting point of your program
// just like Java but much simpler ;) 
// if you dont have a main function like this you will get an error
fn main(){
    println!("hello rust");
}
